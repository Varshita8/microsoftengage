Would need pycharm application.

After uploading the files app.py,similarity.pkl and movies_dict.pkl.

Would need to run two commands pip install streamlit and  pip install protobuf~=3.19.0.

And then you can run the app using streamlit run app.py.

For the pkl files you can also run the jupyter code using ipynb file and download the pkl file and then upload it in pycharm.
